## Business Recommendations 

New Wheels should send out customer surveys to gain more insight as to why customer satisfaction (based on the ratings system), as well as the order frequency, decreases by each quarter. The customer surveys should include questions as to why the customers are buying new vehicles and why they gave the order its specific rating; good, bad, okay etc. It should be hypothesized that many customers will refer to the shipping time as the reason for their discontent. 

New Wheels should get in contact with the vehicle manufacturers to ensure the consistency of the manufacturing of the cars throughout the year as this may be a cause for the decreasing customer satisfaction and order rate by quarter.

The company should work to improve their shipping time as the increase in average shipping time is quite significant.  This is especially concerning since by quarter 4, the average shipping time is about triple the average shipping time in quarter 1.
